This is Experiment 2: Working with Git Shell Commands.
In this experiment, we learn how Git works by performing the following tasks:
1. Initializing a repository using 'git init'.
2. Creating and modifying files inside the working directory.
3. Adding changes to staging using 'git add'.
4. Committing changes using 'git commit'.
5. Creating and switching between branches using 'git branch' and 'git checkout'.
6. Merging a feature branch into main using 'git merge'.
7. Connecting to a remote GitHub repository.
8. Pushing commits to GitHub using 'git push'.
This file is used to track changes and verify the behaviour of Git commands.
